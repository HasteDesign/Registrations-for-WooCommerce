Registrations for WooCommerce allows the creation of the **registration** product type. Registration products can have dates as variations.

There are 3 types of dates:

1. Single day
2. Multiple days
3. Date range

For each date variation you can set the price, schedule, and places available (stock). That makes Registrations for WooCommerce great for stores selling courses, classes or any kind of scheduled services.

**Please notice that WooCommerce must be installed and active.**

== Installation ==

= How to create registration products =

1. Install and activate the Registrations for WooCommerce plugin;
2. Create a new product.
3. In the product edition screen, select `Registration` from the **Product Data** dropdown.
4. Go to the Dates section, choose the date type and add as many dates you want. Make sure to save your dates.
5. Go to the Variation section and create variations for all the dates you created earlier.
6. Setup each date variation. Mark as *virtual*, set the price, stock (available places), start and end time. If your date is a range date, you will need to choose the week days too.
7. Save your variations and publish your product. You will see the available dates as a select field at the product page.
