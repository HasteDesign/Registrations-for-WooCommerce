*** WooCommerce Subscriptions Changelog ***

2015.07.28 - version 1.5.29
 * Tweak: WooCommerce v2.4 compatibility

 * Fix: fix cart calculations thrown off by a simple product that used to be a subscription
 * Fix: copy multiple meta data values for the same key to renewal orders
 * Fix: restrict switching if force http setting is enabled in WooCommerce as moving from https to http will log the user out. Switching relies on an ownership check, which will always fail, and will strip the query arguments from switching making people sign up for new subscriptions instead of switching the one they already have.
 * Fix: manual payment flag being incorrect set on an order initial paid for via a manual payment method, then changed to "Pending" and paid for via a payment method that can process automatic renewals

2015.05.25 - version 1.5.26

 * Fix: WordPress 4.2 compatibility issue with post statuses on the Manage Subscriptions screen
 * Fix: incorrectly clearing cache by Action Scheduler

2015.04.21 - version 1.5.24
 * Fix: incorrect renewal order created when a customer switches with PayPal, the switch includes a gap payment and PayPal sends the 'subscr_signup' IPN before the 'subscr_payment' (which only appears to happen on some PayPal accounts)
 * Fix: variable subscription product's "From:" price displayed on the shop/product pages.
 * Fix: order totals for renewal order created after a subscription was manually reactivated by a store manager after a failed payment left it on-hold
 * Fix: only variables should be passed by reference error on some PHP installations when purchasing with PayPal
 * Fix: undefined index 'txn_id' notice on PayPal IPN handler for subscription sign-ups on a switch or subscription with a free trial

 * Fix: notice displayed on limited subscription products that are part of a Group when not logged in
 * Fix: notice displayed on limited subscription products when switching is disabled completely
 * Fix: upgrade process on some servers where site is running on SSL but $_SERVER['HTTPS'] is not set and server port is something other than the default SSL port (443), causing WordPress' is_ssl() method to return false (this is fixed by WooCommerce's fix_server_vars() method, but that runs on the 'after_setup_theme' hook, while Subscriptions used 'plugins_loaded' for the upgrade process, which occured prior to it)
 * Fix: correctly display the discount string on the Order Received page when a recurring coupon is applied to the purchase.

 * Fix: cart widget with WC 2.3.2+ when a subscription product is in the cart with a $0 recurring total
 * Fix: line tax row display for automatic renewals orders by ensuring that any serialized line item meta data is unserialized before adding it to renewal orders, to avoid it being serialized twice
 * Fix: applying cart or product discount coupon to subscription with $0 in WooCommerce 2.3 via the Checkout page

2015.02.20 - version 1.5.18

 * Tweak: move sign-up fee field to own row on the Edit Product screen to improve display on small screens

 * Fix: Add PayPal IPN transaction ID check for those transactions which have an 'txn_id' field to further try and prevent duplicate IPN handling
 * Fix: Ignore PayPal's 'subscr_eot' IPN message completely. It is incorrectly documented and leads to assorted bugs when appearing at unexpected times, like immediately for subscriptions of only one payment, at the same time as the last payment and when a subscription is cancelled due to failed payments. Subscriptions internal scheduleding is now used exclusively for expiring a subscription and it's failed payment handling is used whenever a subscription payment fails.
